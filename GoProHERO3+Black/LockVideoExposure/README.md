Lock Video Exposure
====================

This hack will lock the exposure at the moment you turn on the cam. So, aim at your ideal exposure, turn it on and hit record button, then all your video will be lock exposed.

Wow, what a christmas gift! I have tried it but AE is locked immediately after camera starts (not after I hit "record" button). So I have to turn off and on camera to "catch" new exposure. Anyway I like it! I will do further testing on day light...
