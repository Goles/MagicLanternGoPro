=================
 
Magic Lantern GoPro (MLGP) is a tool to improve the imaging and lens capabilities of the little action camera. MLGP provides hacks from Lock Exposure to Video effects, including Fisheye removal and much more. 
At the moment, it only supports the GoPro HERO3 Black / + Black and + Silver. 
Every folder is named with a supported camera type, in each folder are the hacks available for the camera.

####This is NOT a firmware like in Magic Lantern for DSLRs, this are individual hacks you put on the gopro.

The MLGP hacks are *NOT* permanent! They modify the camera *ONLY* when the file autoexec.ash is in the SD card.
